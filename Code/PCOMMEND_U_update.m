function U=PCOMMEND_U_update(X,P,E,U,m)

%% This function updates the fuzzy membership matrix (CxN).
% Input:
%   - X: Pixel points (Nxd matrix).
%   - P: Cell of C abundance matrices. One (NxM) matrix per cluster.
%   - E: Cell of C endmembers matrices. One (Mxd) matrix per cluster.
%   - U: the fuzzy membership matrix (CxN).
%   - m: Fuzzifier.
%   - EPS: small positive constant.
% Output:
%   - U: the fuzzy membership matrix (CxN).
