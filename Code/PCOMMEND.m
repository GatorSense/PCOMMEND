function [E,P,U]=PCOMMEND(X,parameters)
%% Main function for PCOMMEND
% This function computes multi-model endmembers and their respective abundances
% Input:
%   - X         : Data (N x D) matrix. N data points of dimensionality D. 
%   - parameters: The parameters set by PCOMMEND_Parameters function.
%
% Output:
%   - E         : Cell of C endmembers matrices. One MxD matrix per cluster.
%   - P         : Cell of C abundance matrices. One NxM matrix per cluster.
%   - U         : Fuzzy membership matrix CxN.
