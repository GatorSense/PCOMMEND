function P=PCOMMEND_P_update(X,E,C,EPS)
%% This function updates the abundace matrices (one per cluster)
% Input:
%   - X:   Pixel points (NxD matrix).
%   - E:   Cell of C endmembers matrices. One (MxD) matrix per cluster.
%   - M:   Number of endmembers.
%   - EPS: Small positive constant.
% Output:
%   - P:  Cell of C abundance matrices. One (NxM) matrix per cluster
